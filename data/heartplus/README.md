# Heart+ keeps exact duplicate groups within a single data split

`Heart+` is the study name for a merged heart-risk cohort, not a standalone clinical registry. The file combines processed 2020 and 2022 tables derived from the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

- Experimental file: `merged_data.csv`
- Raw rows: 764,927
- Usable rows after the frozen cleaning contract: 761,862
- SHA-256: `8c3611f95469b3a06fe33628c2d82283dc3571b57bd0ff9b8c5c63ec44dac27e`
- Split contract: exact-feature duplicate groups remain disjoint
